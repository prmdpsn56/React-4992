## React
### A java script Library for building user interface

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component framework for PHP.It was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and later on Instagram.com in 2012.It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013.

React Native, which enables native Android, iOS, and UWP development with React, was announced at Facebook's React.js Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015.

On April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, a new core algorithm of React framework library for building user interfaces.React Fiber was to become the foundation of any future improvements and feature development of the React framework

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

React makes it easier to create interactive interfaces. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.

## Strengths
### 1.Performance
### 2.Server-side rendering
### 3.Native GUI
### 4.Simplicity

## Prototype
Pharmacy management system aims at providing a simpler management system to the pharmacy owners. The idea behind was to create a simpler management system for pharmacy owners in Asia where every pharmacy owner runs their business individually. The system will show the sale record of the pharmacy and will help the owners to maintain their stock.The idea behind the approach was to use the data from sales in pharmacy to manage their stocks, profit/loss and also to see the sale trends of different medicines. The record will help the shop owners to manage their business and will also show the different pattern in sales of medicines in different regions. The sales pattern of different medicines will help to predict the health problem and also to see what type of medicine people prefer when multiple options are available in the market.React will be used to build the interface of the prototype.We will be using rect to make data visualisation more interactive so that it is easy for the user to get and idea about their stocks and business.The data regarding the sales for aparticular medicine will be our main focus.To show that which medicine has the highest sales in comparison to similar medicines for the same purpose.
