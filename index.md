## React
### A java script Library for building user interface

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

React makes it easier to create interactive interfaces. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.
